# Could you write functions that allow you to:

* Search by book name.
* Display the total number of books onloan/not on loan
* Alter a bookâ€™s status (onloan/not on loan)
* Add a new book to the library
* Remove a book from the library



## This has an associated test file. You can run the test file by installing the required package (pytest)

1) In the terminal, type ```pip install pytest``` and press enter. 
2) Run the tests using ```pytest dictionaries_test.py```.


2 of the tests will currently pass. The rest won't pass as the code hasn't been written yet.
